.:primitives v1 _ by zinexe april 2012

'primitives' is a collection of basic geometric shapes meant to extend the default selection available in Unity by default.

key features:

* 64 high quality uv map optimized primitives
* fast prototype walls
* LOD spheres, geosphere and cubic spheres
* various polyhedra
* inverted spheres, domes, bands, rings, efficient quads


the primitives collection is meant to be lightweight and customizable and consists of geometry commonly used in game development and prototyping scenarios. all geometries are provided as seperate imported models so the collection can be modified to suit the needs of the project. simply drag the models to the gameworld to use as any other primitives. 


all primitives are consistent 1:1 with Unity's unit system and local transforms are exactly aligned to that of Unity's. UV mapping have been applied to remove common map deformations and instead provide interresting and correct texture tiling patterns.

while Unity provides a basic sphere geometry, it is often preferable to vary the mesh detail required (to use with LOD for example). A collection of spherical geometries with various levels of complexity is provided, also including different mesh topology and uv mappings, such as geosphere and cubic projected spheres. 


2 sets of basic wall tiles are also included for fast prototyping to enable 'coder graphics' that load fast and are quick to piece together.

a selection of precise polyhedra geometries are included, along with a small range of commonly used shapes, such as a torus ,disc, star.


*note* colliders are not automatically set on the primitives, as the default generated for imported models are mesh colliders, and in alot of cases another type would be more efficient.


Enjoy! ;)
